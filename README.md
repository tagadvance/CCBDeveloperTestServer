# Back-End Developer Test

## Overview
Your client has tasked you with making a RESTful API to support the ultimate Moviegoers Guide suite of applications.
They are asking for an API that serves up:

* A list of movies
  * The user should be able to search the movies by title
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by rating
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by category
* Movie details for each movie
* A list of actors in a movie

We have provided a mysql database of movie info for you.
We have also provided a starter PHP application using the SLIM framework although you are free to use the language and framework of your choice - Ruby, Node, etc.

## Installation

You will need Docker installed.
Here are the instructions to install Docker for ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)) or ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)).

You will also need to install Composer if you plan to use our start PHP application.
Here are the instructions to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)

Launch the test code with the following commands

```
cd developer_test_server/movies
composer install
cd ../
docker-compose up -d
```

### Verify Installation

In a browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/movies. You should see ```[]``` returned from the request.

_Note_: If you don't see the empty array, run ```docker-compose logs``` and wait for all the containers to be fully loaded. Once the containers are completely loaded you should be able to hit the movies endpoint.
